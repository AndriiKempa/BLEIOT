BLEIOT

Scientific & Technical Research Initiative in BLE, IoT, Embedded Systems, and Hardware Security

BLEIOT is an independent research initiative focused on:
	•	Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) forensic analysis
	•	IoT device security
	•	Embedded debug interface research (JTAG, SWD, Nexus)
	•	Distributed AI infrastructure modeling
	•	RF exposure measurement and compliance

We publish analytical articles, technical documentation, and investigative research exploring the risks and architecture of emerging decentralized AI systems.
